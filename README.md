# Sparrow

### Description
Sparrow is a telegram bot integrated with Twitter API to get Twitter data using predefined set of commands.
While learning Python Flask, I needed a side project to implement the things I learned which lead to creation of Sparrow (My first Telegram Bot )

_Try Sparrow [here](https://t.me/tweegram_smartbot)._

Sparrow supports a limited set of commands, here are they
 - /help : Lists the commands supported by Sparrow
 - /locationtrend \[locationname\] : Gets trending twitter topics for the specified location.
 - /lasttweet \[twitter_handle\] : Gets the last tweet for the specified handle. By default it returns my last tweet :P
